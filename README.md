# neopixel-python-demo
this repo is for programming neopixel led-rings and/or led-strips on Python.

<b>ledlib.py<b/>
the main file. it contains all functions needed.
you can change the led-functions ad the bottom of
the file to your liking.
i.e.: change the order of the demos.

led_neopixel_req.txt
lists all the requirements. which as of now is only 
"adafruit-circuitpython-neopixel". 
in the future i might add additional functions that
might need different modules.

process-kill.py
as mentioned within that file:
use this if you ran the script automatically @ bootup
and want/need to kill it. I do not know if it will
work for you, so use it at your own risk.
